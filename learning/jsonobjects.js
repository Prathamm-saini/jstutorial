// API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests for data or services should be made, and how the responses are delivered, enabling programs to interact without needing to understand each otherâ€™s internal workings.

data format in api responses or

    sometimes we do get array of objects too
